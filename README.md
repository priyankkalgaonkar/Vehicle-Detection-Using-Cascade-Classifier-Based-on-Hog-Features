# Vehicle Detection Using Cascade Classifier Based on HOG Features
Developed in Matlab 2018b

The objective of our Vehicle Detection using Cascade Classifier (VDCC) based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features project is to detect object of interest (vehicles) in video frames. It combines best practices from real-time image processing and pattern recognition techniques of images captured from an image sensor (camera). Our strategy is to combine a well-established HOG detector with Cascade classifier to train our model using the provided testData and eliminate instances of false detections that do not match our learned motor vehicle detection model.
